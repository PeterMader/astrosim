## AstroSim hotkeys
* Arrow keys to translate the viewport (hold **shift** to decrease the translation)
* **+** and **-** to zoom in or out (hold **shift** to decrease the zoom factor)
* **Enter** to toggle the play state of the simulation. If there is an open dialog, this dialog is submitted.
* **L** to toggle object labels.
* **C** to toggle controls.
* **T** to toggle object trails.
* **N** to open the 'Create new object' dialog.
* **S** to open the 'Scene' dialog.
* **P** to open the 'Settings' dialog.
* **X** to close the currently open dialog without submitting it; this only works if no input element is active. If in dragging mode, the dialog reappears when you hit **X**.
* **M** to center the viewport at the origin.
